1.Which statement is a correct syntax to break out of a loop?

break

2.Print i as long as i is less than 6.

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

3.Stop the loop if i is 3.

i = 1
while i < 6:
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

4.In the loop, when i is 3, jump directly to the next iteration.

i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
