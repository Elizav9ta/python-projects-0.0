& 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	x & y	

|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	x | y	

^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	x ^ y	

~	NOT	Inverts all the bits	~x	

<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	x << 2	

>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	x >> 2

exsample:
print(8 >> 2)



"""
The >> operator moves each bit the specified number of times to the right. Empty holes at the left are filled with 0's.

If you move each bit 2 times to the right, 8 becomes 2:
 8 = 0000000000001000
becomes
 2 = 0000000000000010
